title: "How a US Commercial Insurance Broker Cut Quote Times by 77% Without Adding Headcount"
excerpt: "A mid-size commercial insurance broker in the US was spending 25 to 40 minutes per quote request. After deploying an AI-powered quoting layer, that dropped below 10 minutes. Here is what actually changed and what did not."

When the client came to us, they were not losing clients to a competitor. They were losing them to the wait.

A business owner calls looking for commercial liability coverage. They get routed to a queue. A specialist in Manila picks up, gathers the information, runs the numbers, and calls back. By the time the quote lands, forty minutes have passed on a good day. On a bad day, the business owner has already moved on.

The team was not underperforming. The process was simply not built for the volume or the speed that the market now expects.

## What the operation looked like before

The client operates in a competitive segment of the US commercial insurance market: SMB and mid-market businesses looking for general liability, workers' compensation, and commercial property coverage. Deal sizes range from a few thousand dollars to north of $80,000 in annual premium.

Their quoting operation was built on a model that worked well ten years ago. Inbound requests came in by phone and web form. A team of trained specialists, based in the Philippines, handled the triage and initial quoting: gathering business details, running the request through carrier portals, and returning a quote to the prospect.

The model had real strengths. The team was experienced, the quality of the quotes was high, and the specialists knew the product well. But it had two structural problems that compounded as volume grew.

The first was speed. Average time from initial contact to delivered quote sat between 25 and 40 minutes. For a business owner with three tabs open comparing providers, that window is too long.

The second was coverage. The Manila team operated across a defined shift window. Quote requests that came in outside those hours went into a queue and waited. In a market where the competition increasingly offers instant or near-instant responses, that gap was becoming visible.

## The decision not to replace the team

The easiest misread of this project is to frame it as automation replacing people. That is not what happened and it was never the goal.

The client's specialist team had something that no model can replicate in the short term: deep product knowledge, the ability to handle complex accounts, and the relationship skills to close a nervous buyer. Replacing them would have been both operationally risky and commercially shortsighted.

The actual problem was that the team was spending a disproportionate share of their time on straightforward requests that followed a predictable pattern: standard industry codes, clean business histories, coverage needs that mapped cleanly to existing products. These requests did not need a specialist. They needed a fast, accurate first pass.

The shift we proposed was about where human expertise gets applied, not whether it gets applied at all.

## What we built

The solution was a two-layer quoting architecture. An AI agent handles the intake and first-pass quoting layer. Human specialists handle everything that requires judgment, negotiation, or complexity.

The AI layer works as follows. When a request comes in, via web form, chat widget, or phone (converted to structured input), the agent gathers the core business information, runs a qualification check against the carrier criteria, and produces a first-pass quote for eligible accounts. For standard requests, this takes under seven minutes from first contact to delivered quote. The system operates around the clock, seven days a week.

The agent does not pretend to be a human. It is transparent about what it is. And it is explicitly designed to hand off cleanly when a request falls outside its parameters: complex coverage structures, high-risk industry codes, accounts with claims history, or any situation where the prospect signals they want to speak with someone.

Those handoffs go directly to a specialist with full context already captured. The specialist picks up a warm, pre-qualified account rather than starting from scratch.

## What changed in the numbers

Twelve months after full deployment, the picture looked like this.

Quote response time for standard requests dropped from an average of 31 minutes to an average of 7 minutes. That is a 77% reduction. For requests that come in outside business hours, response time went from the next available shift to under 10 minutes regardless of the time of day.

The AI layer now handles the first-pass quoting for 64% of all inbound requests end to end. The remaining 36% get escalated to specialists, but arrive with the intake work already completed.

The specialist team's capacity profile changed significantly. Before the project, roughly 70% of specialist time was absorbed by standard intake and first-pass quoting. After, that proportion dropped to under 25%. The reclaimed time was redirected toward complex accounts and active follow-up on mid-market opportunities where the premium value justified deeper attention.

Conversion on complex accounts, the segment above $30,000 in annual premium, improved by 23% over the same period. The team attributes this directly to having more time to actually work those accounts rather than processing volume.

The cost comparison with a 24/7 human staffing model is instructive even if it was never the primary driver of the decision. Running the equivalent coverage with human agents across all US time zones and states would have required a significant expansion of the Manila team plus dedicated coordination overhead. The AI infrastructure operates at a fraction of that cost for the volume it handles. The investment essentially paid for itself within the first eight months.

## What did not change

The specialists are still there. Their remit got better, not smaller.

The complex accounts, the relationship-dependent renewals, the buyers who want to talk through their risk profile with someone who actually understands it. All of that remains human. The AI layer did not compress the value of that expertise. In several ways it made the conditions for applying it better.

Customer satisfaction scores for the specialist-handled segment held steady through the transition and have since improved modestly. The team links this to shorter wait times on escalations and better-prepared handoffs.

## What this kind of project actually requires

This was not a technology implementation. It was an operational redesign that happened to use AI as one of its components.

The work that preceded the build was significant: mapping the actual decision logic that experienced specialists use when triaging a request, defining the criteria for escalation clearly enough that the AI could apply them consistently, and building the handoff mechanics so that context traveled cleanly between layers.

Getting that logic right took longer than the technical implementation. But it is also the reason the system works. An AI agent that does not accurately reflect how your best people actually make decisions will produce inconsistent output that erodes trust faster than it builds efficiency.

For the client, the output was a quoting operation that is faster for the customer, more focused for the team, and structurally better equipped for growth without a proportional increase in headcount.

If your sales or service operation is running into similar constraints, capacity spread too thin, speed expectations that the current model cannot meet, the conversation usually starts with the same question: where is your team spending time that does not require their actual expertise? That is where the leverage is.
